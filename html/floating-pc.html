			One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
			vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
			domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover <strong>strong</strong> it
			and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him,
			<a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he
			thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its
			four familiar walls.
